# Prawn Roast (Spicy Indian Style)

A bold, spicy prawn roast where juicy prawns are coated in a thick onion–tomato masala and slow-roasted until the oil separates. It’s intense, punchy, pairs beautifully with chapati, paratha, or plain rice.

### Roast Masala

- 2 tbsp **oil** (coconut oil preferred)

## Instructions

### 1. Sear the prawns

1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan on **medium-high heat**.
2. Add marinated prawns and sear for **30–40 seconds per side**.
3. Remove immediately and set aside. Do not overcook.

### 2. Build the roast masala

1. In the same pan, add remaining oil (and butter if using).
2. Add curry leaves and onions. Cook on **medium heat** until deep golden brown — this step is key.
3. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté until raw smell disappears.

### 3. Cook down the tomatoes

1. Add tomatoes and cook until completely broken down and oil starts separating.
2. Add chilli powder, pepper, coriander powder, garam masala, and salt.
3. Cook the masala on **low heat** for 5–7 minutes, stirring often.

### 4. Roast the prawns

1. Add the seared prawns back to the pan.
2. Toss gently to coat them fully in the masala.
3. Roast on **low flame** for **3–4 minutes**, until masala clings tightly to the prawns.

## Serve

- Best served hot with **chapati, paratha**, or steamed rice.
- A squeeze of lemon just before serving lifts the dish.

## Notes

- Overcooking prawns will make them rubbery — keep roasting brief.
- Onion browning defines the depth of flavor here.
- This dish should be spicy, slightly smoky, and dry, not saucy.
