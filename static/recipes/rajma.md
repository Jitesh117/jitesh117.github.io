2. Add bay leaf and cumin seeds; let them splutter.
3. Add onions and sauté until golden brown.
4. Add ginger–garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.
5. Add tomatoes and cook until soft and oil starts separating.

#### 3. Build the curry

1. Add turmeric, chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt.
2. Cook the masala well on low heat until thick and glossy.
3. Add cooked rajma along with some reserved stock.
4. Mash a few beans lightly to thicken the gravy.
5. Simmer uncovered for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

### For the Rice (Chawal)

### Notes

- Slow simmering is key, don’t rush this curry.
- Ghee adds extra comfort, but oil works just fine.
