## Preparation

   Add soya chunks to hot salted water and soak for 10 minutes. Squeeze out all excess water and set aside.

## Making the Chilli Soyabean

1. Heat oil in a pan or wok on high flame.
2. Add garlic, ginger, and green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until aromatic.
3. Add onion and capsicum. Stir‑fry on high heat — they should stay slightly crunchy.
4. Add soy sauce, chilli sauce, ketchup, vinegar, and sugar. Mix well.
5. Add the cornflour slurry and cook until the sauce turns glossy and thick.
6. Toss in the fried soya chunks and mix until well coated.
7. Finish with spring onion greens and switch off the heat.

## Serving

Serve hot with:

- flaky paratha or chapati
- fried rice or noodles
- or eat it as a standalone starter

## Notes

- For extra heat, add crushed dried red chillies.
- Skip maida for a lighter version — cornflour alone works fine.
- Keep the flame high while stir‑frying for that restaurant‑style taste. I mean it's a stretch but you can still try.
