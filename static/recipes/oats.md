- 1/2 cup rolled oats
- 1 scoop whey powder
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder (unsweetened)
- 1 tbsp chia seeds (optional, but recommended)
- 200 ml milk
- 1–2 tsp honey, maple syrup, or jaggery powder (to taste)

## Instructions

1. **Make the protein shake**
   Add a scoop of whey protein powder to the milk, along with honey and cocoa powder. Use a shaker to mix it really well.

2. **Add the protein mix to oats**
   Add the protein milk you just created to oats and the chia seeds in a container. Mix it well.

3. **Rest overnight**
   Cover and refrigerate for at least **6–8 hours** (or overnight). The oats will absorb the liquid and turn fluffy.

4. **Final touch (morning)**
   Give it a good stir. If it feels too thick, add a splash of milk.

5. **Top & serve**
   Add banana slices, seeds, nuts, and dried fruits. Eat cold or slightly warmed.
