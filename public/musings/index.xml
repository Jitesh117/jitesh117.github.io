      <title>To Do, or to Be Perceived as Someone Who Does</title>

      <description>Internet, like in real life, is filled with grifters, i.e. People who portray themselves as someone they aren&amp;rsquo;t.
Following the &amp;ldquo;Fake it till you make it&amp;rdquo; mindset, is a double edged sword, depending on the person. On one hand, it can motivate you to push your limits, on the other hand, it can lead to dishonesty and false pride in yourself.
The dopamine hit you get on your posts, makes it very lucrative to only post a particular kind of content, whether you genuinely enjoy it or not.</description>

      <title>Triumph of the Nerds</title>

      <description>The term &amp;lsquo;Nerd&amp;rsquo;, originally coined as a slur for overly intellectual, socially awkward individuals, is now worn as a badge of honor, but why?
You might think that the present-day nerds are somewhat evolved from their former counterparts, but you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong. The essence of being a nerd is still the same, what has changed is our perception of them.
What&amp;rsquo;s changed now, is that we can see the output of their nerdiness in real time, thanks to the internet boom.</description>

      <description>For the longest time since I had created my twitter account, the only thing which I did was retweet and like. The reason I had created my account was to &amp;ldquo;Learn in public&amp;rdquo;. And that&amp;rsquo;s what I did in my initial days at twitter. Started doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Learnt a bunch of things from this. But after this ended, so did my twitter posts.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to post.</description>

      <description>Whenever I see a youngling posting their project on twitter, it makes me wonder, why have I not done this myself ever? Do I just not have it in me what it takes to build good products?
Or I do have it in me but just don&amp;rsquo;t realise it. Whatever the reason is, the fact remains that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything worth noticing.
So what can I do to solve this issue?</description>

      <description>It was a rainy day of November, when I reached the Pondicherry Railway station with my Dad, excited as well as a little frightened. Loads of Auto walas were shouting &amp;ldquo;Bhaiyya, bhaiyya kidhar jana hai?&amp;rdquo; in their Tamil accent, trying to lure us using Hindi in the Tamil heavy environment. Even though we knew we were being ripped off, dad selected one and we put all of my stuff in the auto and told the driver to go to the &amp;ldquo;Enginerring college&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In the heart of Auroville, a township dedicated to Human Unity, stands Matri-Mandir, a monument that represents &amp;ldquo;The Mother&amp;rdquo;. This is not just an architectural wonder but a gateway to inner peace and spiritual awakening.
The inception of Auroville traces back to the spiritual vision of the Indian philosopher and guru Sri Aurobindo and his partner, known as &amp;ldquo;The Mother&amp;rdquo;. The Mother dreamed of establishing a universal township unlike anywhere else on earth - a place where people from all nations could live together in peace while undertaking an experiment in human unity and evolution.</description>

      <title>Do We Really Know Ourselves?</title>

      <description>One of the most haunting realisations I&amp;rsquo;ve had about myself recently is that I&amp;rsquo;ve let my work define me too much all my life. Like, barring some very close friends, none could pinpoint anything about my personality.
If you&amp;rsquo;d asked anyone from my class about me, the most they could tell about me was that &amp;ldquo;Jitesh likes reading a lot&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not the people&amp;rsquo;s perception about me what&amp;rsquo;s bothering me, but the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t do much apart from my work is troubling me a lot now.</description>

      <title>Why Reading Fiction Matters</title>

      <description>Being in Tech, more often than not, if you ask anyone for book recommendations, they&amp;rsquo;d recommend a non-fiction self-help book. Although non-fiction books have their place, Fiction should never be overlooked.
One thing which makes Fiction books overlooked by the general population is that there is no direct benefit of reading them. When you&amp;rsquo;ve read a non-fictional book, you get know some new knowledge. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the case with Fiction books.</description>

      <title>The Trap of Knowing What You Want</title>

      <description>In our world, we often think that finding our passion and purpose is the key to being happy. But this can actually be a trap. Many people think they know what they want, and they chase after those things, believing they will finally feel satisfied. But then they end up feeling lost and unfulfilled anyway.
Having a clear idea of what you desire can be powerful. But we have to be careful, because this mindset also has its limits.</description>

      <title>Making and Losing Friends</title>

      <description>Friends are the one thing that can change the outlook of anything that is happening in our lives. Having their mere presence can amplify any happiness.
Growing up as a kid whose father worked in the Indian Air Force, I had to switch cities a lot. While it meant I got to make new friends every 3-5 years, it also meant losing most of my friends whenever I changed places. Each new transfer meant saying goodbye to old friends and diving into a new adventure.</description>
