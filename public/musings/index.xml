      <description>Having a short attention span makes it difficult to get things done. You might start an important project, but then get sidetracked checking Instagram or replying to a text message. Before you know it, hours have gone by and you haven&amp;rsquo;t made much progress.
With all the digital distractions these days, Attention Span has become a currency whose exchange rate has never been higher.
You must have searched the web, desperately trying to find a one-size-fits-all formula to get better at focusing.</description>

      <description>There would be times, when you would see a post or a comment on Twitter, where you would really want to meet the person who posted it and punch them in their face. But alas, you can only reply to their post. But before you hit the SEND button, think, do you really want to feed the algorithm to show more similar things like this?
Twitter algorithm, like most social media platforms, is programmed to push whatever will get the most engagement from you, be it likes, comments or retweets.</description>

      <title>Delude yourself to Greatness</title>

      <description>One of the weird things I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed in the tech world, is the skill-to-courage ratio in people. Contrary to popular belief, skill is still in abundance. What&amp;rsquo;s scarce though, is the belief in one&amp;rsquo;s own abilities.
The worst thing one can do, is to doubt themselves. You have to delude yourself everyday, that you can achieve anything you put your mind and soul to.
The amount of opportunities you can get just by being confident in yourself and putting your work out there, is unreal.</description>

      <description>Tech, unlike other fields, changes its landscape every passing day. You can never tell what&amp;rsquo;s trending today will live to see the face of tomorrow or not.
Every other week, a person will emerge with their new shiny &amp;ldquo;Roadmap&amp;rdquo; of any particular domain in tech. Although the intention is right, these Roadmaps often over-simplify the complexity and dynamic nature of the tech ecosystem.
No matter how much one tries to bring order to this chaotic tech world, they fall flat on their face every single time.</description>

      <title>To Do, or to Be Perceived as Someone Who Does</title>

      <description>Internet, like in real life, is filled with grifters, i.e. People who portray themselves as someone they aren&amp;rsquo;t.
Following the &amp;ldquo;Fake it till you make it&amp;rdquo; mindset, is a double edged sword, depending on the person. On one hand, it can motivate you to push your limits, on the other hand, it can lead to dishonesty and false pride in yourself.
The dopamine hit you get on your posts, makes it very lucrative to only post a particular kind of content, whether you genuinely enjoy it or not.</description>

      <description>The term &amp;lsquo;Nerd&amp;rsquo;, originally coined as a slur for overly intellectual, socially awkward individuals, is now worn as a badge of honor, but why?
You might think that the present-day nerds are somewhat evolved from their former counterparts, but you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong. The essence of being a nerd is still the same, what has changed is our perception of them.
What&amp;rsquo;s changed now, is that we can see the output of their nerdiness in real time, thanks to the internet boom.</description>

      <description>For the longest time since I had created my twitter account, the only thing which I did was retweet and like. The reason I had created my account was to &amp;ldquo;Learn in public&amp;rdquo;. And that&amp;rsquo;s what I did in my initial days at twitter. Started doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Learnt a bunch of things from this. But after this ended, so did my twitter posts.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to post.</description>

      <description>Whenever I see a youngling posting their project on twitter, it makes me wonder, why have I not done this myself ever? Do I just not have it in me what it takes to build good products?
Or I do have it in me but just don&amp;rsquo;t realise it. Whatever the reason is, the fact remains that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything worth noticing.
So what can I do to solve this issue?</description>

      <description>It was a rainy day of November, when I reached the Pondicherry Railway station with my Dad, excited as well as a little frightened. Loads of Auto walas were shouting &amp;ldquo;Bhaiyya, bhaiyya kidhar jana hai?&amp;rdquo; in their Tamil accent, trying to lure us using Hindi in the Tamil heavy environment. Even though we knew we were being ripped off, dad selected one and we put all of my stuff in the auto and told the driver to go to the &amp;ldquo;Enginerring college&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In the heart of Auroville, a township dedicated to Human Unity, stands Matri-Mandir, a monument that represents &amp;ldquo;The Mother&amp;rdquo;. This is not just an architectural wonder but a gateway to inner peace and spiritual awakening.
The inception of Auroville traces back to the spiritual vision of the Indian philosopher and guru Sri Aurobindo and his partner, known as &amp;ldquo;The Mother&amp;rdquo;. The Mother dreamed of establishing a universal township unlike anywhere else on earth - a place where people from all nations could live together in peace while undertaking an experiment in human unity and evolution.</description>

      <description>One of the most haunting realisations I&amp;rsquo;ve had about myself recently is that I&amp;rsquo;ve let my work define me too much all my life. Like, barring some very close friends, none could pinpoint anything about my personality.
If you&amp;rsquo;d asked anyone from my class about me, the most they could tell about me was that &amp;ldquo;Jitesh likes reading a lot&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not the people&amp;rsquo;s perception about me what&amp;rsquo;s bothering me, but the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t do much apart from my work is troubling me a lot now.</description>

      <title>Why Reading Fiction Matters</title>

      <description>Being in Tech, more often than not, if you ask anyone for book recommendations, they&amp;rsquo;d recommend a non-fiction self-help book. Although non-fiction books have their place, Fiction should never be overlooked.
One thing which makes Fiction books overlooked by the general population is that there is no direct benefit of reading them. When you&amp;rsquo;ve read a non-fictional book, you get know some new knowledge. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the case with Fiction books.</description>

      <title>The Trap of Knowing What You Want</title>

      <description>In our world, we often think that finding our passion and purpose is the key to being happy. But this can actually be a trap. Many people think they know what they want, and they chase after those things, believing they will finally feel satisfied. But then they end up feeling lost and unfulfilled anyway.
Having a clear idea of what you desire can be powerful. But we have to be careful, because this mindset also has its limits.</description>

      <title>Making and Losing Friends</title>

      <description>Friends are the one thing that can change the outlook of anything that is happening in our lives. Having their mere presence can amplify any happiness.
Growing up as a kid whose father worked in the Indian Air Force, I had to switch cities a lot. While it meant I got to make new friends every 3-5 years, it also meant losing most of my friends whenever I changed places. Each new transfer meant saying goodbye to old friends and diving into a new adventure.</description>
