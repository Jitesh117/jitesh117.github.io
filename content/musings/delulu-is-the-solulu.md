One of the weird things I've witnessed in the tech world, is the skill-to-courage ratio in people.
Contrary to popular belief, skill is still in abundance. What's scarce though, is the belief in one's own abilities.

The worst thing one can do, is to doubt themselves. You **have** to delude yourself everyday, that you can achieve anything you put your mind and soul to.

The amount of opportunities you can get just by being confident in yourself and putting your work out there, is unreal.

Most of the accomplished people in this industry, are not just the top skilled, but also the most active in community. They are the ones who continuously share their work, engage with others, and maintain a presence.

Share everything, even the ideas that seem obvious to you. You'd be surprised to find the number of people resonating with our ideas, some might even start looking upto you.

But don't confuse *deluding* yourself with *cheating* others. You should only show what 's truly yours, and not borrowed. People can sense when something is genuine, and they appreciate honesty. They key is to create something authentic, consistently.

Remember, everyone starts somewhere. The people who are now seen as experts or leaders in their fields were once beginners too. They reached their current status through perseverance, constant learning, and by believing in themselves even when it was difficult.
