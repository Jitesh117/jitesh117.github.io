For the longest time since I had created my twitter account, the only thing which I did was retweet and like. The reason I had created my account was to "Learn in public". 
And that's what I did in my initial days at twitter. Started doing the `#100DaysOfCode` challenge. Learnt a bunch of things from this. But after this ended, so did my twitter posts. 

I didn't know what to post. And even if I did think of posting anything, the thought that I don't have anything worth sharing stopped me from pressing the **Post** button.

Then last year, in December, somehow I stumbled upon [svs](https://x.com/_svs_) and got into his [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aqpg5hjg). And that changed everything.

svs is really bullish on blogging and tweeting about stuff you do or would like to do. His words, and I quote 
> "It’s a total cheat code. All you humble people thinking you got nothing worth saying are totally missing the point. The point is not to advance the state of computer science. The point is to give others the chance to know you. And offer you jobs. The number of interviews I didn’t have to take because of my blog. Unreal."

And now, I post whatever I feel like, interact with like-minded people who I really admire, and not just someone with huge followers or something. 

Ever since I started following this, twitter had become fun again! And I guess having fun is all that matters.
