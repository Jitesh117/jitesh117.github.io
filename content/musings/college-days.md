It was a rainy day of November, when I reached the Pondicherry Railway station with my Dad, excited as well as a little frightened. Loads of Auto walas were shouting "Bhaiyya, bhaiyya kidhar jana hai?" in their Tamil accent, trying to lure us using Hindi in the Tamil heavy environment. Even though we knew we were being ripped off, dad selected one and we put all of my stuff in the auto and told the driver to go to the "Enginerring college".

Going through the streets of Pondicherry was a new experience. Seeing the beautiful solid color painted buildings pass by and the clear weather, made me feel things I had never felt before. I've been to almost all the major corner of India but the South. This was my first experience in South India.

After reaching the college Hostel, we booked room and put all of my stuff there. Dad stayed there only for like an hour and then left. I was alone in the room. It was the fist time I was away from my family. One hour passed, then one of my classmates knocked my door and asked me to come to the Hostel Mess as it was dinner time, i.e. 7 PM. 

Went there and talked a bit with my friends, then went back to my room. Since the wifi was not working, thought I should maybe sleep. Turned off my lights and it suddenly struck me, that life is not the same anymore for me. I'm permanently detached from my home now. Only in vacations or holidays can I go home, and it would never feel the same. Thinking all of this made me very emotional.

Next day, Jasbir, one of my classmates knocked my door and asked if I would like to shift my room and share the room with Rohit, since his room partner had decided to change rooms meaning Rohit is now alone. I agreed as I too, was feeling quite lonely in my room and really needed to not be alone at that time. At that time my mind did not register what a life altering moment that would become.

## Meeting friends IRL

Due to COVID, my first year at college was lost in online classes, so I had only seen my classmates in Google meets. On the first day of college, everyone looked so happy to finally meet each other in real life. Although it was a bit awkward due to language barriers, majority were Tamil speaking, rest were Hindi, Telugu and Malayalam speaking. 
Hesitant at first, we all made friends quite quickly, thanks to english being a common denominator among us.

The first 2 months went like a breeze, shuffling between studying for college and trying to learn the basics of Web Development, i.e., HTML, CSS and JS. In this period, spent most of the time in learning Git, GitHub and the Frontend Web Dev stuff.

## COVID, AGAIN!

In december COVID again went to a rise, so college was again shut down for a month.
After coming back to home, started learning DSA and doing LeetCode religiously, along with starting with doing challenges on [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) . Doing these challenges really made the somewhat boring college subjects bearable.

## Early College days

The college environment was not what I expected to be honest, it was more school-like than my school. Along with my roommate, Rohit, Made a strict schedule of waking up at 4:30, learn new DSA stuff, do some LeetCode, have breakfast, then go to college at 9. After coming back to hostel, work on FrontendMentor challenges, revise what I learnt in the morning and then go to sleep and repeat.
Following this schedule in those days really paid off I would say.
