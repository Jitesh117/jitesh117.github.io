Talking about politics is a tricky thing to crack. One has to be cautious not to be swayed away with their emotions while discussing with their peers. And no matter how much you try, your beliefs will cloud your judgement. 

Politics is controversial, we all know that. But why? Why do we people not hesitate to fight even with our loved ones over "Petty" politics, you might ask. But in my opinion, discussing about politics is not petty at all. The line between politics and religion is often blurred in our society. We don't even realise it but religion and politics are intertwined and destined to remain so for time eternal.

Discussing politics is so controversial that most people refrain from sharing their political views publicly. You won't believe but this article has been in my drafts for months. Whenever I thought of posting it, something pulled my hand back. Fear of backlash? Losing followers online? Friendships compromised? You name it. I feared it all. But then I thought? Do I really need these if I can't be the real me? **NO**.

I work in a domain that is filled with people who never took their social science textbooks seriously. You may find my tone condescending but that's genuinely what I've observed. All of their political knowledge comes form Instagram, twitter posts, YouTube video essays and podcasts. And this is a really dangerous situation to be in.
