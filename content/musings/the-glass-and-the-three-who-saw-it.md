The optimist looked with eyes aglow,  
"Half full!" he declared, in a hopeful flow.  
The pessimist frowned, with a sigh so deep,  
"Half empty," he murmured, no joy to keep.

They argued and fought over fate's cruel game,  
Who was right, who was wrong, who could claim?  
The world of their words, so loud, so bright,  
Lost in the noise, they missed the bite.

For as they debated, too caught in the fight,  
The opportunist, silent, took flightâ€”  
A swift, quiet sip from the glass in the fray,  
And then, with a smile, he walked away.

The glass was empty, but none had seen,  
The truth was simple, and sharp, and keen.  
While others debated, too caught in their role,  
The opportunist drank, and moved toward his goal.
