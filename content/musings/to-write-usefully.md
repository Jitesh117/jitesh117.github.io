One of the things I've heard many people say, is to write usefully. They say write stuff which people would find useful for their lives, and therefore want to read more. Sure that's a way to increase readership for your work, but that shouldn't influence one's writings. Drawing imaginary boundaries in your head is one of the worst things you can do.

Knowing that there are real people who actually read my writings sometimes makes me want to write a particular kind of things, which I may like or not. These things make it harder to write something which may not be of much importance to the reader.
But should that be the norm?

Why can't the writing be just, a medium to solidify my thoughts? One of the main things which I write for is not just for the reader to gain something new, but to deliver *my*  thoughts to the world, and to my future self.

Which makes writing in some sense, useful for *me*.
