There has been a significant shift in Tech Twitter since late 2023. More and more anonymous devs with an anime pfp are popping off on this platform. One binding force between all of them is their ability to deliver great content. Some people even call them "Cracked Devs".

But what's the reason behind this sudden rise? One of my theories is that the 4chan kids are now grown up and now want to tame Twitter according to their likings since they're now too used to being anonymous.

Anonymity has its benefits. You've no reputation to lose. So you can share your candid opinions, and experimental code and critique industry practices without fear of backlash from employers or peers. This fosters open dialogue and discussion. There are no repercussions whatsoever.

Despite their anonymity, many anon devs have built substantial credibility on Twitter through consistent high-quality contributions. They've established a reputation purely based on their work/posts.
