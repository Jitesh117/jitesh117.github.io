Whether you like it or not, Computers are now an integral part of our lives. But is this for the better? That's a discussion for another day.

And to make the most out of your computer, your hand needs to becomme one with our keyboard. Learning the tools at your disposal really makes a huge difference.
I've covered how to get faster at typing in one of my previous [posts](https://jitesh117.github.io/blog/how-i-learned-to-type-fast/).

It's surreal that anyone can post about their thoughts or work for everyone in the world to see. If you're good at what you do, the algorithm will take care of the rest and make your work reach the right people.

One tweet seen by the right person can *and* has changed lives for the better. It's upto the person how they decide to tap the potential of the opportunities the World Wide Web offers. The key is to be original and engage with the community authentically. 

The internet has truly democraticized knowledge and information like never before. Resources that were available to only a privileged few are now up for grabs for everyone with an internet connection. The barrier to entry has never been lower.

If you make an optimal use of the tools provided by the internet, you'll discover that the possibilities are truly limitless.

You are your future's own architect now.
