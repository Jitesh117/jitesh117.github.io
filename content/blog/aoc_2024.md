> The aoc_lib package used in these solutions is my own custom helper functions library. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/jitesh117/aoc_lib). I'll try to post my solutions daily. These are probably not the most optimized solutions. That is not my goal with advent of code honestly, I do these just for fun.

## Day 1

[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) was pretty straightforward. Just some basic array magic. I don't think the code needs much explanation.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"

	aoc_lib "github.com/Jitesh117/aoc_lib"
)

func part1(input []string) int {
	var leftList, rightList []int

	for _, line := range input {
		nums := aoc_lib.StringToIntSlice(line)
		leftList = append(leftList, nums[0])
		rightList = append(rightList, nums[1])
	}

	sort.Ints(leftList)
	sort.Ints(rightList)

	result := 0
	for i := 0; i < len(leftList); i++ {
		diff := leftList[i] - rightList[i]
		if diff < 0 {
			diff = -diff
		}
		result += diff
	}

	return result
}

func part2(input []string) int {
	var leftList, rightList []int

	for _, line := range input {
		nums := aoc_lib.StringToIntSlice(line)
		leftList = append(leftList, nums[0])
		rightList = append(rightList, nums[1])
	}

	rightCount := make(map[int]int)
	for _, num := range rightList {
		rightCount[num]++
	}

	similarityScore := 0
	for _, num := range leftList {
		if count, exists := rightCount[num]; exists {
			similarityScore += num * count
		}
	}

	return similarityScore
}

func main() {
	lines := aoc_lib.ReadLines("input.txt")

	resultPart1 := part1(lines)
	resultPart2 := part2(lines)

	fmt.Printf("Part 1: %d\n", resultPart1)
	fmt.Printf("Part 2: %d\n", resultPart2)
}

```
