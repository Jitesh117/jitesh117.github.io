2025 was filled with rollercoasters. Had a lot of ups, some downs, but it felt good. Didn't expect it to end on such a good note.

Starting this blog turned out to be _the_ best career decision for me hands down. This year, due to my blog, I got so many great things happen to me:

1. Got recognised at my workplace by entity leads.
2. Got some really sweet freelance content writing gigs.
3. 2 of my tech blogs blew up, many senior engineers DMed me to join their orgs.
4. Reached 30K+ readers across 100+ countries. Now the major chunk of my readers come organically through search engine results.
5. Got a bunch of job offers, that too without an interview!

## Analytics

Now onto the juicy part, the numbers.

## Why you should start blogging too

Blogging was one of the best things I started last year, and stuck to it. The returns it gave is incomparable, I won't lie. I am so glad I stumbled upon [@_svs_](https://x.com/_svs_). He dropped some really good advice on why to start writing.

> "It’s a total cheat code. All you humble people thinking you got nothing worth saying are totally missing the point. The point is not to advance the state of computer science. The point is to give others the chance to know you. And offer you jobs. The number of interviews I didn’t have to take because of my blog. Unreal."

## Conclusion

Looking back, this year proved something very clearly to me: writing compounds.

None of the outcomes I mentioned were planned. I didn’t start this blog to get offers, recognition, or DMs from people I admire. I started it to think better, learn in public, and document things I found interesting. Everything else was a side effect.

The biggest win wasn’t the numbers or the opportunities, it was clarity. Writing forced me to slow down, understand things deeply, and express myself better. Over time, that clarity started reflecting in my work, my confidence, and the way people perceived me.

If there’s one takeaway from 2025, it’s this: consistency beats talent, and visibility beats silence. You don’t need to be an expert. You just need to show up, write honestly, and stick around long enough for compounding to do its thing.

I’m grateful for everyone who read, shared, emailed, or just quietly lurked. This blog has already given me more than I ever expected, and I’m just getting started.
