So, you made it through the first week. Youâ€™re moving around with `hjkl`, and youâ€™ve stopped instinctively reaching for your mouse. Thatâ€™s a win.

But now youâ€™re starting to realize thereâ€™s _so much more_ to Vim. And youâ€™re right. The second week is where things get exciting. Letâ€™s take your skills to the next level.

---

## Day 8: Leveling Up Your Movements

By now, youâ€™re comfortable with `hjkl`, `w`, `b`, and `$`, but letâ€™s move even faster.

### Faster Navigation:

- `gg` â†’ Go to the top of the file
- `G` â†’ Go to the bottom of the file
- `{` â†’ Move up by a paragraph
- `}` â†’ Move down by a paragraph
- `Ctrl-d` â†’ Move down half a screen
- `Ctrl-u` â†’ Move up half a screen

### Precision Jumps:

- `fx` â†’ Move to the next occurrence of `x` on the current line
- `tx` â†’ Move **before** the next occurrence of `x`
- `Fx` â†’ Move **backwards** to `x`
- `Tx` â†’ Move **before** `x` (backwards)

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal for today**: Navigate large files with ease. Try moving with `gg`, `G`, `{`, `}` and refine with `f`, `t`, `F`, `T`.

## Day 9: Mastering Text Objects

One of Vimâ€™s superpowers is **text objects**. They let you operate on words, sentences, and blocks of text efficiently.

### Editing Inside and Around Objects:

- `ciw` â†’ Change _inner_ word (delete & enter insert mode)
- `diw` â†’ Delete _inner_ word
- `yiw` â†’ Yank _inner_ word
- `ci"` â†’ Change everything inside `"`
- `di(` â†’ Delete everything inside `()`
- `da{` â†’ Delete _around_ `{}` (including brackets)

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal for today**: Try `ciw`, `diw`, `ci"`, and `di(` on a text file.

## Day 10: Searching and Replacing Like a Pro

You already know how to search with `/word`, but letâ€™s refine it.

### Smarter Searching:

- `/word\c` â†’ Case-insensitive search
- `*` â†’ Search for the word under the cursor
- `#` â†’ Search _backward_ for the word under the cursor

### Global Find and Replace:

- `:%s/old/new/g` â†’ Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new"
- `:%s/old/new/gc` â†’ Replace all with confirmation

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal for today**: Search and replace words in a document efficiently.

## Day 11: Buffers, Tabs, and Windows

Vim can manage multiple files. Letâ€™s ditch the old `:e` and get serious. You can check out my blog post on this topic [here](https://jitesh117.github.io/vim_stuff/buffers-windows-and-tabs-in-vim/)

### Buffers:

- `:e file` â†’ Open a new file
- `:ls` â†’ List open buffers
- `:bnext` (`:bn`) â†’ Go to the next buffer
- `:bprev` (`:bp`) â†’ Go to the previous buffer
- `:bd` â†’ Close the current buffer

### Windows (Splits):

- `:split` â†’ Horizontal split
- `:vsplit` â†’ Vertical split
- `Ctrl-w w` â†’ Switch between windows
- `Ctrl-w q` â†’ Close the current window

### Tabs:

- `:tabnew file` â†’ Open a file in a new tab
- `gt` â†’ Move to the next tab
- `gT` â†’ Move to the previous tab
- `:tabclose` â†’ Close the current tab

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal for today**: Manage multiple files using buffers, splits, and tabs.

## Day 12: Macros â€“ Automate Everything

I've wrote about macros in great detail [here](https://jitesh117.github.io/vim_stuff/vim_macros/)
Macros let you record a series of commands and repeat them.

### Recording and Playing Macros:

1. Start recording: `q[a-z]` (e.g., `qa` to record in register `a`)
2. Perform some actions
3. Stop recording: `q`
4. Replay macro: `@a`
5. Repeat last macro: `@@`

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal for today**: Record a macro to format or edit multiple lines and replay it.

## Day 13: Visual Mode and Block Editing

To read about visual mode in detail, checkout this [blog](https://jitesh117.github.io/vim_stuff/master-visual-mode/) of mine,

### Visual Mode Basics:

- `v` â†’ Start character-wise selection
- `V` â†’ Start line-wise selection
- `Ctrl-v` â†’ Start **block** selection (useful for column editing!)

### Block Editing Magic:

- Select a column with `Ctrl-v`
- Press `I` (insert mode) and type something
- Press `Esc`, and it applies to **all** selected lines!

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal for today**: Use `Ctrl-v` to insert text at the beginning of multiple lines at once.

## Day 14: Making Vim _Yours_

Now that youâ€™ve got the basics down, letâ€™s tweak Vim to fit your workflow.

### Essential `.vimrc` Settings:

```vim
set number          " Show line numbers
set relativenumber  " Relative numbers for quick movement
set ignorecase      " Case-insensitive search
set smartcase       " Case-sensitive if uppercase letters are used
set incsearch       " Incremental search
set hlsearch        " Highlight search matches
set wildmenu        " Better command-line completion
set expandtab       " Use spaces instead of tabs
set shiftwidth=4    " Indent by 4 spaces
set tabstop=4       " A tab counts as 4 spaces
```

## Final Thoughts

Youâ€™ve made it through your second week, and now Vim feels _a little less scary_. Youâ€™re moving faster, editing with text objects, jumping around files, and even using macros.

The journey doesnâ€™t end hereâ€”Vim mastery takes time. But if you keep practicing, soon youâ€™ll wonder how you ever lived without it.

Happy vimming!
