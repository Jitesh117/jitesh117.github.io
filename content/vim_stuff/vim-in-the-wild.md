Vim keybindings have become a standard feature in modern software. If an app deals with text input, there's a good chance it supports Vim modes. And if it doesn’t, it probably should.

## Everywhere You Look

LeetCode, Obsidian, Google Colab—each of these platforms recognizes that many users prefer Vim keybindings. Even mainstream editors like VS Code and JetBrains IDEs provide first-party extensions for Vim emulation. Why? Because users expect it. The efficiency and muscle memory that Vim offers are unmatched, and developers don’t want to lose that when switching between tools.

Even browsers have extensions to bring Vim navigation to the web. Tools like SurfingKeys and Vimium let users browse the internet without touching a mouse. This just proves how deeply ingrained Vim-style interaction has become in productivity workflows.

## A Sign of Seriousness

When a product lacks Vim keybindings, it sends a message: "We didn’t think about power users." It’s not just a niche preference; it’s a sign that the developers understand and respect how people work. If your software expects users to type, edit, and navigate text, then supporting Vim is the bare minimum.

Ignoring Vim users is like designing a keyboard without arrow keys. Sure, some people might not use them, but for those who do, it's an essential part of their workflow. Not including Vim support makes an application feel incomplete.

## The Standard, Not the Exception

Vim isn't just an editor; it's a way of interacting with text. That’s why it keeps showing up everywhere. If you’re building a tool for serious users, Vim keybindings shouldn’t be an afterthought—they should be a default. The best tools don’t fight against user habits; they embrace them.
